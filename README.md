# CMPLXSY-Async-Prey-Predator-Group-7
CMPLXSY S11 - Async Learning Task: Prey-Predator Ecosystems

This predator-prey ecosystem models the cat and mouse interaction. 

Prey - Mouse
Predator - Cat
Food - Grass

In this scenario, mouse feeds on the grass on the floor. The cat feeds on the mouse to maintain energy. The grass on the floor regrows within a user-defined time. Other values that can also be defined by the user or in the user interface would be the initial number of mouse and cat (through sliders). The interface also contains the graph of the population at given time, as well as the current population for each object at the given tick. The option to show energy is also given.
